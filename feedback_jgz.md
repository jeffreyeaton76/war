# Project Feedback

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Really great job with planning and and tracking your work! While the wireframe is small, getting into that habit will really help you a ton in the long run.  I liked the user stories, and your readme covered everything it needed too.  I am also happy to see a good amount of branching, and committing early and often!

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. Your project shows a great understanding of the concepts and materials we've covered so far! I really love that you tried to push yourself for a 3-player option as well. I understand that was super difficult, but a great step in the right direction!

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**.  Please review my inline comments (prefixed with my initials - "JGZ") for suggestions to help improve code quality.  Moving forward, I recommend checking all your `html` and `css` with the appropriate validators to help catch errors. I love the commenting you provided to explain some of the more complicated functions! This will be so important moving forward, especially when you're working in groups. I noted a few areas that could be improved; most specifically, giving semantic variable names to things like "this.player.length" when it's repeated over and over. Just makes the code look cleaner!
There were also a couple spots in CSS that could be shortened up, and the html validator returned a couple errors.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations** Really nice work with this! I saw some really creative and clever solutions to difficult problems.  I'm sure with a little more time you could've figured out some of the kinks with the 3-player version as well!
