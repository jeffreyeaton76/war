User Stories

As a developer, I should be able to create a deck, shuffle it, and deal half of it to the user and the computer.

As a user, I should be able to deal two cards (one from my pile and one from the computer's) and have those  cards compared so as to determine the winner of that round.

As a user, I should see my score kept somewhere on the webpage.

As a user, when the cards are tied the game should deal two cards face down (one for each player) and then "flip" again and the score for that round should go up by three. 

As a user, I should know when the deck has run out and who won the game.

As a user, I should be able to restart the program to play again.
