User Stories

As a developer, I should be able to create a deck, shuffle it, and deal half of it to the user and the computer.

As a user, I should be able to deal two cards (one from my pile and one from the computer's) and have those  cards compared so as to determine the winner of that round.

As a user, I should see my score kept somewhere on the webpage. 

As a user, I should know when the deck has run out and who won the game.

As a user, I should be able to restart the program to play again.
